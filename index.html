       <h3>Welcome</h3>
    
    
       
 <p>Few people have the time to read the official 400-page budget document released by the Guilford County Government. On top of that, it is filled with spreadsheets and financial language that can be difficult to understand. While this may be necessary for Guilford officials to manage the millions of dollars in county assets, it is probably not the best format for tax-payers to understand the budget. 
       </p>
       
       

    
   <p>
That’s where this guide comes in to play. Without the endless spreadsheets or complicated financial jargon, we'll break down some of the key areas Guilford County's budget that are of interest to Guilford residents. We'll also look at some of the ways Guilford services impact people's every-day lives. Hopefully, this interactive guide will help bring the budget "to life", making it more transparent and inclusive in the process.

     The first important question to answer to better understand the budget is: where does the money come from? After all, without revenue, the budget would not exist.</p>
        
    <p>     
As the pie chart below shows, the property tax is the largest contributor to Guilford County’s budget. At 63.7 %, the property tax makes up more than a majority of the revenue in Guilford County. The other largest contributors are the sales tax (14.8 %) and funds from Federal and State Governments (12.2 %). When combined, these three sources account for over 90% percent of county revenue.

You can also click on specific elements of the charts to isolate them.

        <h4>Property Tax</h4>
        <p>How much you pay in property tax in Guilford County is determined by the value of the property you own. Essentially it is a percentage of the total appraised value of your property. At less than one percent of total property value, this percentage is % 0.7305. Check out the graphic below for an example.

 <h4>Sales Tax</h4>

 <p>
The local sales tax in Guilford County is 2% of all local purchases. It can be determined by multiplying a purchase by 0.02. For example, a $1.00 purchase on a soft drink at a convenience store would garner a local sales tax of 2 cents.

  Now that we know where Guilford County's budget revenue, the next question is: what services does the county provide? Because there are so many, grouping the numerous departments and programs into categories known as Service Areas helps to better navigate the budget by the type of service provided.  </p>
        <p>
    Guilford County services are divided into six distinct service groups: Education, Public Safety, Human Services, General Government, Support Services, and Community Services. This section gives a brief introduction these service groups and some of their programs. This will be helpful for when we look at the spending data in the next section.

   The Education service area aims to give Guilford County residents the knowledge and tools to be successful in a rapidly changing modern economy. While education funding is mostly a function of the State, all counties are expected to contribute. Like most counties, Guilford County's contribution exceeds the minimum required by law.

       <p> But what if we wanted a little more detail about the programs in the service areas? As we know, each service area contains multiple departments. Using the same colors at the previous chart, the individual departments are grouped by service area. The smaller individual boxes inside each color-coded service area grouping are the individual departments, which you can hover over for more specific information about their budget allocation.  The tree map gives us a little more detail because it shows us how much money is being spent in each department, providing us with graphical representation of the entire budget.

<p>While a tree-chart depicting the entire budget is easier to digest than a massive spreadsheet, it can still be a little confusing. So let’s drill down to where it matters most to many Guilford residents: how local money is being spent. We can do this by taking out the Federal and State funding and only looking at how local property and sales tax are being spent. As the chart below shows, if we only look at the allocation of local money by department, we notice that 8 departments make up for around 90% percent of local spending.</p>

       <p>Every day, Guilford residents interact with services provided by Guilford County. As we know, all of these services belong to a dedicated service area and are in many cases made possible by locally-based taxes. Many of these services make a difference in the everyday lives of Guilford residents. Yet, because the benefits residents receive from these services are often indirect, they sometimes go un-noticed.

        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        
        <p>Hopefully, this guide has been helpful in making the Guilford County budget more inclusive and transparent. While we did not cover the budget in its entirety, we hit on some of the major concepts of it including: </p>
         
        <ul>
        <li>Revenue Sources</li>  
        <li>Service Areas And Programs</li>    
        <li>The Allocation of Local Money</li>  
        <li>How Guilford Services Impact Residents' Everyday Lives</li>  
        </ul>   
            
            
 
            <p>If you would like more information, Guilford County makes all of its budget information <a href='https://www.guilfordcountync.gov/our-county/budget-management-evaluation/fy-2018-19-budget'>available</a> to the public. After reading this guide, you should be more equipped to understand the terminology used, allowing you to look deeper into how locally-based revenue is allocated. </p>     
             
            <div id='last'>
            <p>A better understanding of these topics can help you better know how to use Guilford Services when you or a loved one may need them. It can also help you be more informed on topics more civic in nature, such as deciding which policies to support or which candidates to vote for in local elections. With more a more informed public, we can work together to make the best use of our local funding so that Guilford County can continue to work to better allocate funds, guide policies, and improve services for Guilford Residents. </p>   </div>
